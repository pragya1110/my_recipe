Ihis recipe will help you make a perfect lemonade for summers............:)

It wont be a very long recipe nor is it going to be very hard to follow.

if you just stir all of these together the sugar will sink to the bottom.

Start with the proportions of 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of water, 1 cup of lemon juice.Reduce the amount of sugar if you like your lemonade to be less sweet.

step 1:
make a simple syrup first, by heating water and sugar together until the sugar is completely dissolved, and then mix that with the lemon juice.The proportions will vary depending on how sweet and strong you like your lemonade, and how sour your lemons are to begin with. Late season lemons are less sour than early season lemons.

step 2:
Make the simple syrup, combine with the lemon juice, and then add more water (and ice) to dilute the lemonade to your taste.



AND..........THAT'S IT.

NOTE:For more intense lemon flavor, grate the zest from one fresh lemon and add the zest to the simple syrup as you are making it. Once the sugar has dissolved in the water remove from heat and let the zest seep in the simple syrup for several minutes, then strain out the zest when you add the simple syrup to the lemon juice.
